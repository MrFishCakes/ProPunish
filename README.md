#### Description
ProPunish aims to be your solution with infractions. It will aim to hold mutes, bans and warnings before the 1.0 release. It will then expand into having punishments for IP addresses.

#### What is ProPunish?
I am glad that you asked! Yes there is a vast market of punishment plugins out there and I have tried to make some in the past. Needless to say I didn't do too well and now I intend to make this my best attempt before going to university.

#### Where can I download?
Right now, no downloads are available as the plugin isn't complete. If you want to compile the code however feel free!

#### Installation
Installing is really easy, just follow these steps:
1. Stop the server.
2. Download the correct version (Spigot/BungeeCord).
3. Place the Jar in your "plugins" folder.
4. Start the server, the plugin does the hard work.
5. Configure the plugin to your liking.

#### Dependencies
Add dependencies required at downloaded when the server starts. If your server doesn't have an internet connection then you _should_ be able to download the version marked "DEP-IN" for all dependencies to be present within the Jar.

There currently is no API for you to access. I do plan on introducing one but it isn't my top priority. Sorry!
